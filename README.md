In my repository, you will find several files to run my simulation. After loading the files into your directory, go into Terminal and access that directory. 
Once there, type in "python .\search.py". This will run the simulation and show you the robot with the best fitness.
I am not done with this part of the project, so I haven't messed with fitness yet. I need to play around with sensor and motor neurons first.
